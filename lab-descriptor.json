    "objective": "This lab is focussed on building multiplexer and demultiplexer combinational circuits using basic logic gates and universal gates. By doing so, the student will be able to compare the gate level involved in the circuit and also the number of gates required for the design. The students will also understand how to scale up the 2:1 mux to a 4:1 mux. Once the student understands this design approach he would be able to build higher order multiplexers.",
